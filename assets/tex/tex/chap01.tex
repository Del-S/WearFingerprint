As the technology evolves it unlocks more and more possibilities. Just few years back there were no such things as smart phones or smart watches but now they are important part of our lives. And as they evolve there is the need for them to have more functions. One of them is to locate it's position on the map. This is possible using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). There is multiple implementation of this system like GPS, GLONASS or Galileo. All of these systems provide location using sufficient number (at least 4) of satellites. \iffalse[https://books.google.cz/books?id=Np7y43HU_m8C&printsec=frontcover&hl=cs#v=onepage&q&f=false]\fi GNSS  solution requires clear path between satellites and the device so It cannot be used indoor because the signal is not able to pass through buildings.
\\That is why there needs to be another solution for indoor localization.
