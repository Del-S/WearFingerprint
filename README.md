# WearNavigation

Android application that receives signal strength from Bluetooth (iBeacons) and WiFi networks to locate user inside building. It is written for Android mobile phone and Android Wear 2.0. Application uses fingerprints (previous readings) from both devices to figure out the location.

Smart parts
- Combination of multiple devices for collecting Fingerprints.
- Will combination increase precision.
- Combinaction of different algorithms to locate more precisely.

### Current features

- Bluetooth devices scan.
- Scanning for BLE iBeacons.
- Tile floor map.
- Database of fingerprints.
- Scanning for new fingerprints.

### Next features

- Fingerprint scanner for Wear part.
- Passinf scanner data between Mobile and Wear part.

### Postponed features

- Implementing location algorithms.
- Display of location on the screen.
- Combination of location algorithms.
