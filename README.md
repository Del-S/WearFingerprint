# WearNavigation

Android application that receives signal strength from Bluetooth (iBeacons) and WiFi networks to locate user inside building. It is written for Android mobile phone and Android Wear 2.0. Application uses fingerprints (previous readings) from both devices to figure out the location.

Smart parts
- Combination of multiple devices for collecting Fingerprints.
- Will combination increase precision.
- Combinaction of different algorithms to locate more precisely.

### Current features

- Bluetooth devices scan.
- Scanning for BLE iBeacons.
- Tile floor map.
- Database of fingerprints.
- Scanning for new fingerprints.
- Fingerprint scanner for Wear part.
- Passing scanner data between Mobile and Wear part.

### Next features

- Save fingerprints on the server.
- Display fingerprint in specific location.
- Text for the thesis.
- Floor, building and scan time changes.


### Postponed features

- Implementing location algorithms.
- Display of location on the screen.
- Combination of location algorithms.
